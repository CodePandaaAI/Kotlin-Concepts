# 🚀 Coroutines — Coming Soon!

This section will cover:
- `suspend` functions
- `CoroutineScope` and dispatchers
- `launch` vs `async`
- `Flow` for reactive streams
- Structured concurrency

For now, check out `oop/SealedClasses.kt` for the sealed state pattern
that's commonly used WITH coroutines for managing async UI states.
